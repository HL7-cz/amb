### Introduction

This implementation guide specifies a set of rules to be applied to HL7 FHIR to define **Outpatient Encounter Report** (or any kind of similar encounter) in the Czech national context.

Its main objective is to define the content components and the preferred structure to be used. The purpose of this standard is to define the representation of the discharge report as a patient's medical record for the purpose of electronic exchange between individuals, healthcare providers and infrastructure components in the Czech Republic.

This includes both national and cross-border scenarios.
